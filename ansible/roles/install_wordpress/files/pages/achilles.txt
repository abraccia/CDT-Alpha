Title: On Glory, Honor, and Why I’m Not Fighting Today
Author: Achilles, Son of Peleus
Date: Siege Day 3,917

To those who keep asking where I’ve been: I’m in my tent. Reading. Reflecting. Sharpening my spear (occasionally).

Why? Because I refuse to fight for commanders who treat honor like a rationed meal — something to hand out or withdraw based on their moods.

Agamemnon took Briseis. Not just a woman, but a symbol of my earned status. That act was not just petty — it was strategic humiliation.

If we fight for kleos (glory), there must be rules. If we serve gods and kings without integrity, what’s left of us? A name in a song and nothing else.

I am not your blunt sword. I am not your beast of the front line. I’ll return to battle when my dignity is restored — not before.

⚠️ Editor’s Note: Since publishing this post, several Greek commanders have tried to reason with Achilles. Odysseus, in particular, left a very long and emotional scroll. No response has been received.
