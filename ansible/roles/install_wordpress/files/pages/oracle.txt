Title: A Dream from the Citadel: Beware of Gifts Bearing Greeks
Author: The Seeress of the Smokeless Fire
Date: Night Before the Unnamed Gift Arrives

Tonight, I saw a horse with no rider. It bled from its flanks but made no sound. Inside its hollow belly: the breath of men, the smell of iron. The stars turned backward in the sky.

The people cheer tomorrow’s offering — a “gift” from the Achaeans, who say they’ve departed. I say: do not bring it inside. Do not touch it. Burn it. Cast it to sea.

But as always, the truth is quieter than flattery. And I am merely a voice in the wind.

Cassandra weeps. No one listens. But the city hums with fatal joy.

Let it be known — this post will be my last. Tomorrow, they crown the wood with laurel. I will not be among them.

🕊️ May the gods remember the voices drowned by celebration.
